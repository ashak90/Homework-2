## Description

    Created a homepage from portfolio. This page has a hero space, with a picture or me (Asha Kuamr), a short paragraph of my background, and links with how people can get in contact with me. It also has a section where I dsplay cards describing my work, with a picture describing each project. Please note, that to view the deployed link for Code Refactor, please click on the description, not the picture. Finally, the "let's Connect" section provides more ways hoe people can get in contact with me.
