## Description

    Created a homepage from my portfolio. This page has a hero space, with a picture of me (Asha Kuamr), a short paragraph of my background, and links with how people can get in contact with me. It also has a section where I display cards describing my work, with a picture describing each project. Finally, the "let's Connect" section provides more ways how people can get in contact with me.
